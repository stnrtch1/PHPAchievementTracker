- All visuals will be handled by bootstrap

- Games should be able to be added, edited, and removed from the tracker.
- When adding a game, the user should be able to enter: The Game Name, Achievements Earned and Max Achievements per game.
- When editing a game, the user should only be able to change the Achievements Earned and Max Achievements totals.
- When deleting a game, there must be a popup to confirm the game deletion.

- Notifications should be used for when these actions are performed i.e. "Game has been added", "Game has been deleted"

- The table will start by being organized by game names in alphabetical order
- The user should have the ability to change the order of the table by: Name, Achievements Earned, Max Achievements and Achievement Completion

- There will be two counters at the end of the table:
- One will keep track of how many achievements have been earned and show an appropriate percentage
- The second will keep track of the average achievement completion rate between all games

Game Object:
